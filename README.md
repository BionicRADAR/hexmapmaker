# hexmapmaker
A Java program for my own use for making hexmaps (maps with hexagonal tiles)
The hex map maker is a program I wrote for my own use for making a hex map. It has two main parts: the hex maker, which allows a user to put in an image and crop it down to make it a hexagon for use in the hex map, and the map maker, which uses hexagonal tiles the user has added to make the map.
As of now, a number of things can only really be changed by hardcoding that, if I'd written it for anyone besides just me, would be unacceptable. In addition, it only does one orientation of hexagon (points going vertically).
If you want to use it but find that its shortcomings are too much, try contacting me.
Were I to put more work in it, probably the first step would be some cleanup to remove some of the hardcoded nonsense, followed by making "horizontal-point" hexagons useable (which could potentially be easy, but could also be very difficult).
