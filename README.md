# hexmapmaker
A Java program for for making hexmaps (maps made of tesselated hexagonal tiles)  


The hex map maker is a program I wrote for my own use for making a hex map. It has two main parts: the hex maker, which allows a user to put in an image and crop it down to make it a hexagon for use in the hex map, and the map maker, which uses hexagonal tiles the user has made to make the map.  


As of now, it only does one orientation of hexagon (points going vertically, which is probably the less normal orientation).  


If future work is put into this project, it would probably go into some cleanup to remove some hardcoded values, followed by making "horizontal-point" hexagons useable (which could potentially be easy, but could also be very difficult).
